# Payment Method Fee Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation enhances the payment method system to support both percentage-based and fixed-amount fees, providing more flexibility for different payment providers and business requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `fee_type` column (VARCHAR) with values 'percentage' or 'fixed' (default: 'percentage')
- Added `fee_amount` column (DECIMAL) for fixed fee amounts
- Added constraint to ensure `fee_type` is valid
- Updated sample data to include new fee fields

### 2. Backend Changes
- Updated `PaymentMethod` interface in `src/actions/payments.ts` to include new fee fields
- Modified `CreatePaymentMethodData` and `UpdatePaymentMethodData` interfaces
- Updated Xendit payment route to calculate fees based on fee type
- Added fee calculation logic for both percentage and fixed fee types

### 3. Frontend Changes
- Updated payment methods admin page UI to support fee type selection
- Added form fields for both percentage and fixed amount fees
- Implemented dynamic fee input based on selected fee type
- Updated fee display to show either percentage or currency format

### 4. Utility Functions
- Added `calculatePaymentFee` helper function in `use-payment-methods.ts`
- Updated `formatPaymentMethod` to include new fee fields

### 5. Sample Data
- Updated `sample-data-complete.sql` and `sample-data.md` to include new fee fields
- Set appropriate fee types and values for sample payment methods

### 6. Migration Script
- Created migration script to add new columns to existing databases
- Added constraint validation for fee types
- Preserved existing data while adding new functionality

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the migration script on your database
2. Access the payment methods admin page
3. Create or edit payment methods with different fee types:
   - Percentage-based fees (e.g., 2.0% for e-wallets)
   - Fixed-amount fees (e.g., Rp 4,000 for virtual accounts)
4. Test payment processing with different fee types
5. Verify fee calculations are correct in payment records

## Notes

- Existing payment methods will default to 'percentage' fee type
- When fee_type is 'percentage', fee_amount is ignored
- When fee_type is 'fixed', fee_percentage is ignored
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing data
