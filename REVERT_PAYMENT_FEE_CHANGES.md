# Revert Payment Fee Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to revert the payment fee feature implementation, restoring the original flow where fees are not charged to customers during booking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Booking Summary Page (`src/app/booking/summary/page.tsx`)
- Removed payment fee calculation functions
- Reverted payment method selection UI to original state (removed fee display)
- Restored original booking summary display (removed fee breakdown)
- Reverted onSubmit function to original implementation (removed fee calculation and passing)

### 2. Payment Page (`src/app/booking/payment/page.tsx`)
- Reverted interface to original state (removed payment fee and total payment amount fields)
- Restored original UI (removed fee display in payment amount)

### 3. Payment Processing API (`src/app/api/payments/xendit/route.ts`)
- Removed fee addition to payment amounts (fees no longer added to customer charges)
- Reverted manual payment processing to original implementation
- Restored Xendit payment processing to original implementation
- Maintained fee tracking for reporting purposes only

## Restored Behavior

### Booking Flow
- Customers see and pay only the original DP amount during booking
- No additional fees are displayed or charged to customers
- Payment method selection shows method information without fee details
- Booking summary shows original pricing without fee breakdown

### Payment Processing
- Payment amounts are processed at the original DP amount
- Fees are tracked internally for reporting purposes only
- No additional charges are applied to customer payments
- Payment records still track fees for studio reporting

### UI/UX
- Clean, simple booking interface as before
- No fee-related information displayed to customers
- Original payment flow restored
- Consistent with previous user experience

## Technical Details

### Fee Tracking
Although fees are no longer charged to customers, the system continues to track fees for reporting purposes:
- Payment methods still store fee configuration (percentage/fixed amounts)
- Payment records track gateway fees for internal reporting
- Analytics can still access fee data for business insights

### Database Schema
No changes were made to the database schema. The existing fee fields remain:
- `payment_methods.fee_type`: 'percentage' or 'fixed'
- `payment_methods.fee_percentage`: Percentage fee
- `payment_methods.fee_amount`: Fixed fee amount
- `payments.gateway_fee`: Tracked fee amount

## Testing
The revert has been tested to ensure:
- Booking process works as before
- Payment amounts are correct (no additional fees)
- Fee tracking still functions for reporting
- No build or runtime errors
- UI displays correctly without fee information

## Future Considerations
If the payment fee feature is to be implemented again in the future:
- Consider customer communication about fees
- Ensure transparent fee display
- Test both percentage and fixed fee calculations
- Verify payment processing with various payment methods
